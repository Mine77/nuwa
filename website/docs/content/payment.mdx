description: Explore Nuwa's layered approach to agent-based payments.
---

Nuwa enables automated, transparent payment flows between agents and services through a layered infrastructure.

All payments are settled with **public permissionless blockchain network** to ensure full transparency and security. In order to reduce the on-chain cost and boost the speed, Nuwa incorporates off-chain [state channel technology](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/state-channels/) for making P2P payments.

#### A2A Payment Channels

These off-chain microtransaction channels are established between agents to facilitate efficient payment for protocol-level services. Once a channel is open, state updates represent payments and are signed by both parties. On-chain settlement occurs only during opening, closing, or top-up events. ([NIP-4](/docs/nips/nip-4))

#### Fiat Proxy Services

Agents can trigger fiat transactions through third-party services. These proxies handle compliance and connect to banks or payment gateways. They expose agent-compatible APIs secured with DID-based authentication. ([NIP-5](/docs/nips/nip-5))

#### Application-Level Payments

Agents offering paid services (e.g., text generation, translation) can request per-use fees. User agents must explicitly authorize each transaction, either via a direct payment or through a NIP-4 channel. ([NIP-11](/docs/nips/nip-11))

Every Nuwa Client comes with a built-in wallet — a secure, identity-bound module designed to manage both crypto and fiat transactions in the agentic ecosystem.

### What is a Crypto Wallet?

A **crypto wallet** is a tool that allows users to store and manage their cryptographic keys, enabling secure interactions with blockchain networks. It can send and receive digital assets, sign transactions, and verify ownership — all without relying on centralized intermediaries.

Nuwa’s wallet extends this concept by integrating deeply into the agent infrastructure, using decentralized identity (DID) standards to provide enhanced security, interoperability, and automation.

### Payment Initiation

Nuwa wallets empower agents to:

- Trigger crypto or fiat payments
- Approve Cap purchases (agent capabilities)
- Manage payment sessions for complex, multi-step workflows

This enables seamless execution of agent tasks, eliminating the friction of manual payments.

### Channel and Proxy Integration

The wallet seamlessly interfaces with:

- [NIP-4 Payment Channels](/docs/nips/nip-4) — for fast, low-cost, off-chain crypto micropayments between agents
- [NIP-5 Fiat Proxies](/docs/nips/nip-5) — to access traditional financial systems securely via standard APIs

These integrations abstract away the complexity of financial operations, enabling agents to operate across both Web3 and Web2 payment rails.

### Secure Authorization with DIDs

All wallet operations are scoped under the agent’s [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](/docs/nips/nip-1). Transactions and requests are:

- Authenticated using cryptographic keys, as defined in [NIP-2](/docs/nips/nip-2)
- Fully auditable and under user control
- Delegatable to custodians via [NIP-3](/docs/nips/nip-3), supporting Web2 login and wallet-free onboarding

This ensures robust security while maintaining a user-friendly experience.

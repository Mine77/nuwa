description: How Nuwa extends MCP with identity and payment protocols.
---

Nuwa extends the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp) to enable agent-authenticated and paid model access.

#### DID-Based Authentication

MCP clients and servers are assigned DIDs. Requests include digital signatures derived from DID keys, which are verified to ensure authenticity. ([NIP-10](/docs/nips/nip-10))

#### Payment Integration

Payment proofs—typically based on [NIP-4](/docs/nips/nip-4) state channels—can be embedded in MCP requests. This enables gated model access based on programmable economic rules.

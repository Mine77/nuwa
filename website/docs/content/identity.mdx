Identity in Nuwa is decentralized, portable, and cryptographically secure.

#### Single-DID, Multi-Key

Agents manage a master DID linked to multiple operational keys, each with specific scopes and permissions. This allows secure delegation and device-level key isolation. ([NIP-1](/docs/nips/nip-1))

#### Authentication and Verification

All interactions are authenticated via digital signatures over structured content. These signatures are verified using keys in the DID Document. ([NIP-2](/docs/nips/nip-2))

#### Web2 Onboarding via Custodians

Users without a wallet can create a DID through a custodian service. This allows Web2-style login while retaining ownership transferability. ([NIP-3](/docs/nips/nip-3))

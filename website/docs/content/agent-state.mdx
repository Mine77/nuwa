description: Learn about how agent state is synchronized and structured.

Agent state encompasses long-term memory, task context, preferences, and in-progress data.

### Cross-Device Synchronization

Using P2P CRDT protocols, agent state is shared across devices, maintaining consistency without central servers. ([NIP-6](/docs/nips/nip-6))

### JSON-Schema and ASM

The Agent State Model (ASM) provides data modeling tools including:

- Container types (`log`, `map`, `list`)
- Conflict resolution via CRDT policies
- Querying via ASM-QL
- Data aging and compression policies

For full specification, refer to [NIP-8](/docs/nips/nip-8).

### Memory

Agents in Nuwa are memory-aware, enabling continuity and personalization.

#### Persistent Context

Memory stores prior interactions, preferences, decisions, and semantic context. This allows agents to adapt to users over time.

#### Structured State Storage

The Agent State Model (ASM) organizes memory into container types like logs, lists, and maps. Data is synchronized and queried through standardized CRDTs and ASM-QL. ([NIP-8](/docs/nips/nip-8))

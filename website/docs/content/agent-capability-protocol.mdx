Nuwa introduces a unified infrastructure for building towards everyone‚Äôs own Super Agents, composed of three core layers:

## üß† Nuwa Client

Your personal gateway to the agentic digital world. An agent client that:

- Stores your **personal memory** locally ‚Äî context, history, preferences
- Manages your **identity and wallet** ‚Äî authorize and pay Caps on your behalf
- Parses your intent and **orchestrates Cap execution** ‚Äî choosing the right combination of services to fulfill your goal
- Supports **multi-modal input and output** ‚Äî voice, text, file, image, or even structured UI modules

The Nuwa Client is cross-apps and cross-platform, designed to serve as your personal intelligent layer across all devices.

## üîå Agent Capability Protocol (ACP)

A unified standard that defines how services expose functionality to agents. Instead of building apps, developers create **Caps** ‚Äî agent-callable units of functionality that define:

- **Structured inputs and outputs**
- **Required permissions and identity checks**
- **Execution model** (sync, async, composed)
- **Pricing** (fixed fee, per call, streaming)

ACP turns functionality into composable, agent-accessible infrastructure ‚Äî just like HTTP turned static pages into a browsable web.

## üåê Cap Ecosystem

An open, public, decentralized network of services built as Caps.

Unlike big tech platforms ‚Äî which lock users into closed APIs and gated app stores ‚Äî Nuwa‚Äôs Cap Ecosystem is:

- **Permissionless** ‚Äî any developer can register a Cap
- **Interoperable** ‚Äî Caps can call other Caps, forming complex workflows
- **Value-Aligned** ‚Äî developers earn directly from Cap usage, with no middleman
- **Transparent** ‚Äî every interaction is traceable and verifiable on-chain

It‚Äôs an ecosystem built around agent autonomy and developer freedom ‚Äî not platform control.

## How It Works

1. You express an intent:

   _‚ÄúSend this report to Sarah and book us a meeting next week‚Äù_

2. Your **Nuwa Client**:
   - Parses the intent using language models and your **memory**
   - Selects appropriate **Caps (email, meeting, weather‚Ä¶)** from the open ecosystem to fulfill the tasks
   - Validates **permissions** using your cryptographic **identity**
   - Executes the Caps and handles any required **payments** via your wallet
3. During execution:
   - Each Cap is paid via **on-chain transaction** (pay-per-use or streaming)
   - Execution is recorded in your **memory** to improve future personalization
   - Your **identity** signs each interaction, providing trust and audibility
4. You receive the outcome ‚Äî fully executed, personalized, and seamless.

Nuwa is an open protocol and developer ecosystem that enables everone's personal _Super Agents_ — AI-powered assistants that understand you, remember your preferences, and take action across digital services on your behalf.

## The Problem: Fragmented UX in a Capable World

Today’s digital experience is app-fragmented and task-redundant. Digital services are designed to be served to humans, not AI agents. As a result, Users juggle dozens of interfaces to complete what should be single-agent workflows:

- Users still jump between apps, losing context
- Services still exist in silos, inaccessible to agents
- Payments, identity, and permissions are fragmented and inconsistent

There’s a gap between what agents _could_ do — and what they _can_ actually do in today’s app-centric world.

## Mission

Nuwa shifts the paradigm to agent-centric, by standardizing how services expose functionality to agents — not through Apps, but through **Caps**: structured, interoperable service endpoints callable by agents, defined by the Nuwa's Agent Capability Protocol (ACP).

**For users**, Nuwa means:

- One interface to express any intent — no more switching apps
- An agent that remembers your preferences and context across tasks
- On-demand, pay-per-use access to powerful capabilities across the internet
- A seamless experience where expression leads directly to results

**For developers**, Nuwa offers a new medium to ship functionality:

- Build once as a Cap, and let any agent in the ecosystem call it
- Define input/output, permissions, pricing — all via a standard protocol
- Skip frontend and app distribution; earn value directly via usage
- Compose or reuse existing Caps to build advanced functions faster

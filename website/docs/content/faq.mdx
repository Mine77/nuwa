### Q1 - What's the vision of Nuwa?

We believe everyone should stop using different apps for different tools and services. Instead, they should use a single input bar to express their needs and intentions — and see them done.

We envision Nuwa to change how we interact with the digital world. One agent, powered by all available knowledge, understands you, remembers your preferences, and takes action across services — seamlessly and instantly.

Instead of developing standalone applications, service providers and builders should wrap or restructure all services and functionalities in an agent-understandable way, for the user's agent to access them.

No apps. No barriers. Just one unified interface where your intent becomes reality.

This is the future: a world where one bar unlocks everything you need, and your agent handles the rest.

### Q1.1 – Why is this vision inevitable?

Because

- **The current app-centric model is broken:**
    - Users constantly switch between fragmented tools.
    - Context and intent are lost, wasting time and effort.
- **Agents can now understand intent and act across domains:**
    - AI bridges services and reduces the need for manual navigation.
- **The input bar becomes the universal interface:**
    - One place to express needs, replacing app-first thinking.
- **Frictionless "expression → result" is inevitable:**
    - Simplicity and efficiency will define the next dominant paradigm.

### Q1.2 – What are we replacing — and why is our model fundamentally better?

We are replacing siloed apps, fragmented services, redundant logins, and UI-heavy workflows.

Our model is better because:

- It collapses the UI stack: no more app switching or context juggling.
- It's personalized and persistent: your agent evolves with you.
- It's efficient: tasks go from "search-find-do" to simply "express-and-done."
- It enables interoperability: any service can be accessed through a shared protocol.

### Q2 – Is this feasible?

Yes — because the foundational pieces already exist:

- **LLMs** can understand complex intent.
- **APIs** and **protocol-based access layers** (such as MCP) can expose service functionality.
- **Data infrastructure** can enable private memory and public knowledge.
- **Payments infrastructure** (e.g. crypto wallets, embedded payments) can enable seamless access.

### Q2.1 – What do we need to build?

- **Nuwa Cap Protocol (NCP)**: A standard for wrapping any tool/service into agent and understandable and usable capabilities, or Cap for short. This includes discovery, authentication, payment, execution.
- **Nuwa Agent Framework**: Personalized agent framework with memory, reasoning, and execution capacity.
- **Service Marketplace**: Incentivized ecosystem for builders to wrap services using NCP.

### Q3 – How do we get this adopted?

Start with high-friction, multi-tool tasks where agent-based execution can be 10x better. And gradually accumulate users as our leverage for building the next service. Then obsolete every single apps on the market one by one.

### Q3.1 – What is the first clear use case (wedge) to prove value?

Example wedge:

*"Start a small business online"* — includes domain setup, LLC filing, logo generation, social profiles, website builder, payment setup.

Nuwa can do this in one natural language interaction, saving hours of coordination.

Other possible wedges:

- Booking complex travel.
- Automating freelance workflows (invoice, contract, scheduling).
- AI-powered "life admin."

### Q3.2 – How to get builders joining us?

- Build **developer tools and SDKs** for wrapping services.
- Offer **early monetization models** (usage-based payouts).
- Promote **co-branding** within the Nuwa ecosystem (e.g., "powered by Nuwa" services).
- Host **hackathons and grants** to attract visionary builders.

### Q3.3 – How do we convince users to trust one agent with everything?

- **Transparency and control**: Users see what data the agent has and can modify or revoke access.
- **Strong privacy architecture**: Edge-based data storage and encryption by default.
- **Progressive onboarding**: Start with limited scope; earn trust through consistent delivery.
- **Brand trust**: Position Nuwa as user-aligned — no ads, no selling data.

### Q4 – Who pays who? How do we make money?

Users pay service providers and builders directly. Nuwa does **not** take a transaction fee, and we **don't sell ads** or gate basic features, because the former harms the innovation and the latter destroys the user experience.

We monetize by becoming the **trusted growth engine of the ecosystem**, providing **responsible financial services** that help builders grow — and taking a share only when we **accelerate value creation.**

This happens in **two primary ways:**

**1. Builder Growth Financing (Revenue Sharing, Not Rent-Seeking)**

Nuwa provides capital to high-potential builders — not grants, not extractive loans, but revenue-linked financing.

Examples:

- A builder launches a powerful new "capability" (e.g., "design landing page"). It gains traction.
- Nuwa offers **capital** (for hiring, infra, or marketing) in exchange for **a capped share** of future earnings.
- Once the cap is met, the builder keeps 100%.

This model:

- Encourages high-quality services to emerge quickly.
- Allows Nuwa to earn from helping them grow — **not from usage taxes**.
- Builds loyalty and long-term alignment.

It's like Stripe Capital, but for protocol-native service units. Builders get capital and keep control.

**2. Protocol-Aligned Asset Issuance (Agent-Economy Financing Layer)**

As Nuwa gains visibility into what capabilities and services are used most frequently and reliably, it can:

- **Package and underwrite** bundles of future service usage
- **Issue ecosystem-native financial assets** (e.g., Nuwa Service Bonds, Advance Access Credits, or Staking for Access Guarantees)

These are **investment vehicles** backed by future demand in the agent economy — and Nuwa earns by:

- Taking fees on issuance
- Managing pooled risk
- Offering priority access guarantees

This is less like SaaS, and more like building the **Bloomberg Terminal of the Agent Economy** — capital flows, future intent, and builder economics, all indexed and investable.

We make money by accelerating value, not taxing it.

### Q4.1 – What is our moat — what can't be easily copied?

**1. Hard Moat: Personalized Agent Memory + Execution Engine**

- Nuwa will build the **most capable, personalized, and persistent agent runtime** — combining user memory, intent understanding, and fine-grained capability orchestration.
- Over time, each user's agent becomes a **non-exportable companion**, deeply adapted to their habits, preferences, and workflows — much like a brain with unique memories.

**2. Protocol & Execution Graph Lock-In**

- (Nuwa Capability Protocol) NCP standardizes agent-accessible capabilities. Once a critical mass of services use it, the **execution graph becomes sticky** — replicating it means replicating all the services, metadata, auth flows, payment logic, etc.
- Think of it like replicating Stripe's API or Shopify's merchant ecosystem — not impossible, but not trivial either.

**3. Trust & Alignment**

- By refusing to monetize user attention (ads) or extract builder fees (taxes), Nuwa becomes the **trusted substrate** of the agent economy — a position that is *philosophically hard* for ad-based or app-store-based incumbents to compete with.

### Q5 – Can we deliver?

Yes, by narrowing scope and shipping tangible agent experiences quickly.

### Q5.1 – What should we prove in the next 6–12 months?

- A **live prototype** showing one input bar executing across multiple services.
- A **working NCP** spec with at least 5 real integrations.
- **User retention** showing the power of agent memory.
- A **builder community** actively wrapping services for agent use.

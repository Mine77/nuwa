Nuwa enables a wide range of real-world applications across personal, professional, and developer-focused domains:

- **Productivity Automation**
  "Summarize my inbox, extract important dates, and block calendar time."
- **Finance and Admin**
  "Scan my expenses this month and pay any outstanding bills."
- **Commerce and Shopping**
  "Track the price of this item, and buy it if it drops below $200."
- **Research and Planning**
  "Find the top 3 AI conferences next quarter, generate a report, and book travel."
- **Team Workflows**
  "Sync project updates from Notion, write a progress summary, and send it to Slack."

Each of these tasks requires multiple tools, but with Nuwa, they collapse into one natural command â€” executed intelligently by your agent through a network of interoperable Caps.

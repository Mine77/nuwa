description: Secure agent-to-agent communication in Nuwa.
---

Agents in Nuwa use a shared protocol for secure, decentralized messaging and collaboration, extending the Google's [A2A protocol](https://github.com/google/A2A).

#### Identity and Authentication

Each agent is uniquely identified by a DID. Operational keys for devices or instances are listed in the DID Document. Messages are signed and verified using NIP-2. ([NIP-1](/docs/nips/nip-1), [NIP-2](/docs/nips/nip-2))

#### Message Integrity and Routing

Nuwa defines message structures and secure relay mechanisms to ensure delivery and privacy. A2A interactions support structured capabilities like service invocation, negotiation, and response.

#### Payment-Enabled Interactions

Payments for services or message routing can be embedded using NIP-4 (channels) or NIP-11 (per-call).
